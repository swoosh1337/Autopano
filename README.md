# Auto Panorama

The Image Panorama Stitching Project aims to create a seamless panorama image by stitching two or more images together. The algorithm used for stitching the images relies on finding common local features between the images, which are then aligned and blended together to create the final panorama.

## Project Description

The project requires capturing multiple images, each of which should have at least 30-50% repeated local features with other images. Once the images are captured, the stitching algorithm can be used to combine them into a single seamless panorama image.

The stitching algorithm used in this project is designed to work for most image sets, but some sets may require additional creativity to achieve optimal results. The algorithm relies on identifying common features in the images, aligning them, and then blending them together to create the final panorama.

##How to Use

To use this project, simply capture multiple images that have similar features and run the provided stitching algorithm. The algorithm will automatically detect the common features and align the images to create a seamless panorama. The resulting panorama image can then be saved and shared.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome and encouraged. If you have any ideas for improving the stitching algorithm or would like to add additional features, please feel free to submit a pull request.
